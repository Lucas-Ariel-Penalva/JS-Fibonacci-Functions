#### The Fibonacci sequence starts from 0 and 1 and each following number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

## ***0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21....***

Coding challenges that use the Fibonacci sequence are very common and I solved many of those while practicing and developing my coding skills. These problems were how I learned more about ***Recursion and Dynamic Programming***. I include the problem descriptions and the solutions in the Javascript file.
